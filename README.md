RSA Algorithm
=============

Design and implementation through Java language of the RSA algorithm, developed for the exam of "combinatory e cryptography". Within the project, several algorithms were implemented:

- Computation of the gcd between two integer numbers.
- Computation of the continue fractions, of a given fraction.
- Primality test of an integer number, through the Miller-Rabin test.
- Attack with low exponents, through the Wiener theorem.
